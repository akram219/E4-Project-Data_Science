    #1 Check if Dash is correctly installed
    
    #2 You need to downlowd the file "appdash.py" on you laptop and memorise its place. 
    
    #3 You need to run : "python3 appdash.py" in your terminal. 
    
    #4 A web address will be return, such as : "http://127.0.0.1:8050/" Copy and paste it on google. 
    
    #5 End - You can tryu the website.
